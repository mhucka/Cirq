def read_file_filtered(filename, begin_skip, end_skip):
    """Return lines from a file, skipping lines between markers.

    The strings `begin_skip` and `end_skip` indicate the start & end markers.
    They must be alone on separate lines of the input. Testing is done with
    str.startwith(...), which allows `begin_skip` and `end_skip` to be only
    the first parts of the markers. Matching is case-sensitive.

    Important: the start & end markers must not be nested.

    Args:
        filename: the name or path string of the file to read and process.
        begin_skip: beginning text of a line indicating start of skipping.
        end_skip: beginning text of a line indicating end of skipping.
    Returns:
        the contents of `filename` as a string, minus lines bracketed by
        `begin_stip` and `end_skip`, inclusive.
    Raises:
        ValueError: if the file contains unbalanced markers.
