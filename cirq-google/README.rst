This Python module is |cirq-google|, which provides everything you'll need to
run |cirq|_ quantum algorithms on the Google `Quantum Computing Service
<https://quantumai.google/cirq/google/concepts>`__. It also contains
additional tools for calibration and characterization of Google's quantum
devices.

|cirq|_ is a Python package for writing, manipulating, and running `quantum
circuits <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit>`__ on quantum
computers and simulators. Cirq provides useful abstractions for dealing with
today’s `noisy intermediate-scale quantum <https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862>`__
(NISQ) computers, where the details of quantum hardware are vital to achieving
state-of-the-art results. For more information about Cirq, please visit the
|cirq-docs|_.

|*Access to Google quantum hardware is currently restricted to those in|
|an approved group. In order to use the devices, you will need to apply|
|for access, typically in partnership with a Google sponsor.*          |

Installation
------------

This module is built on top of |cirq|_; installing this module will
automatically install |cirq-core| and other dependencies. There are two
installation options for the |cirq-google| module:

* To install the stable version of |cirq-google|, use ``pip install cirq-google``.

* To install the pre-release version of |cirq-google|, use ``pip install
  cirq-google~=1.0.dev``. (The ``~=`` has a special meaning to ``pip`` of
  selecting the latest version compatible with the ``1.*`` and ``dev`` in the
  name. Despite appearances, this will not install an old version 1.0 release!)

If you would like to install Cirq with all the optional modules, not just
|cirq-google|, then instead of the above commands, use ``pip install cirq`` for
the stable release or ``pip install cirq~=1.0.dev`` for the latest pre-release
version.


Documentation
-------------

To get started with using Google quantum computers through Cirq, please refer to
the following documentation:

* `Access and authentication <https://quantumai.google/cirq/google/access>`__

* `Getting started guide
  <https://quantumai.google/cirq/tutorials/google/start>`__

To get started with using Cirq in general, please refer to the |cirq-docs|_.
