[Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) is a Python library for writing,
manipulating, and optimizing quantum circuits and running them against
quantum computers and simulators.

This module is **cirq-pasqal**, which provides everything you'll need to
run Cirq quantum algorithms on pasqal quantum computers.

# Installation

To install the stable version of only **cirq-pasqal**, use
`pip install cirq-pasqal`. To install the
pre-release version of only **cirq-pasqal**, use
`pip install cirq-pasqal~=1.0.dev`.

Note, that this will install both **cirq-pasqal** and **cirq-core**.

To get all the optional modules installed, you'll have to use
`pip install cirq` or
`pip install cirq~=1.0.dev` for the
pre-release version.
